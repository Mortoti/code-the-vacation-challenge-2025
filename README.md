# 🏆 NOLAP TECH - Code the Vacation Challenge 2025 🏆

Welcome to the official showcase for the **Code the Vacation Challenge 2025**!

This challenge was the first major project for the NOLAP TECH Python bootcamp, where **13 students participated**. The task was to build a project of **their choice** using **only** the fundamental concepts taught up to that point: loops, lists, conditionals, functions, and (for those who started later) dictionaries.

The primary goal was to encourage students to apply core concepts creatively and build ambitious projects. The focus was on the **vision, architecture, and creative solutions** they came up with, demonstrating their understanding. While some projects may have minor bugs (a natural part of coding!), we are celebrating the incredible effort shown in these submissions.

*Please note: This challenge was separate from the final end-of-bootcamp project, which all students must complete to receive their Certificate of Completion.*

A huge congratulations to *all* participants! Below is the "Hall of Fame" for our challenge winners and a list of all participants.

## 🥇 Best Overall Winner 🥇
### Project: GradeMaster
**Winner: Isaac Atoeyine Anafo**

This project was the perfect all-rounder. It's a highly practical, real-world tool that was built with outstanding technical skill. Its clean, modular structure and flawless logic made it the top project of the competition. Congratulations!

**Key Features:**
* **Dual-Path Logic:** Correctly calculates *either* CWA (from marks) or GPA (from grades) based on the user's school system.
* **Full Academic Classification:** Includes a complete classification system to grade the final score (e.g., "First Class," "Second Class Upper," etc.).
* **Clean Modular Code:** Perfectly separated into functions, each with a single responsibility (e.g., `get_course_data`, `calculate_cwa`, `classify_gpa`).

## 💻 Most Technical Project 💻
### Project: Mini Library Management System
**Participant: Richmond Frimpong**

This was, by far, the most complex application submitted. It featured a perfectly modular design, managed complex data with nested dictionaries, and included advanced features from a real-world service.

**Key Features:**
* **State Management:** Uses a nested dictionary as a "database" to track the *state* of each book (e.g., `{"available": True, "borrower": None}`).
* **Admin/User Roles:** Features a password-protected "Librarian" admin panel to view confidential borrower and delivery records.
* **Payment & Delivery System:** Simulates a real service by handling delivery fees, pickup options, and payment verification.

## 🎨 Most Creative Project 🎨
### Project: AOM GAMES
**Participant: Nkrumah Joel**

This was an incredibly ambitious project, featuring a 5-game arcade with a sign-up system. The **Riddle Game** was a standout, with a brilliant, unique scoring system inspired by the NSMQ that awarded points based on how fast you solved the clues.

**Key Features:**
* **Multi-Game Arcade:** A 5-game hub including Rock-Paper-Scissors, Sci-Math Quiz, Hangman, and "Tumtum anaa Koko" (Red or Black).
* **Unique NSMQ Scoring:** A brilliant riddle game with scoring inspired by the NSMQ (5 points for 1st clue, 4 for 2nd, 3 thereafter).
* **Complete App Flow:** Built with a user sign-up and password validation system from the start.

## 🎤 Best Presentation 🎤
### Project: LORDISH BANKING SYSTEM
**Participant: Azumah Lordaria**

This was a highly creative, bug-free, and 100% genuine project. The student built a complete, realistic, multi-step application from scratch and was able to explain every single part of it perfectly.

**Key Features:**
* **High-Security Workflow:** A 4-step user verification flow: Account Creation -> Login -> PIN Creation -> PIN Login.
* **Brute-Force Protection:** The secure PIN login features a 3-attempt limit and will lock the user out (exiting the program) on failure.
* **Bug-Free Transactions:** A flawless, bug-free banking menu for deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.

## 🌟 Honourable Mention 🌟
### Project: REBECCASTYLEZ MATCHER
**Participant: Rebecca Antobre**

A fantastic and personal idea that was 100% genuine student work. It showed an excellent grasp of conditional logic by building a smart "Outfit Suggestion Engine" that matched outfits based on occasion, comfort, and weather.

**Key Features:**
* **Smart Suggestion Engine:** A complex `if/elif` logic tree that finds a specific outfit based on 3 different user inputs (occasion, comfort, weather).
* **Defensive Coding:** Includes `else` blocks that provide a "default" outfit if the user's input is invalid, preventing errors.
* **Feedback System:** A complete feedback loop where a user can rate the suggested outfit and view their history.
